2. **Planning** – Break work into increments, identify dependencies, estimate scope, and create a release plan.
3. **Execution & Tracking** – Manage day-to-day progress, use project boards, follow PR workflows, and track quality/testing.
4. **Risk Management & Communication** – Maintain a risk register, communicate status and risks, escalate as needed.
5. **Release & Deployment** – Standardize releases, ensure pre-release checks, document release notes and rollback procedures.
6. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** – Capture learnings, define improvements, and follow up on previous actions.
